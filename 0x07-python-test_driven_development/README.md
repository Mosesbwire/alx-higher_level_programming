## TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

Test driven development(TDD), starts with writing a failing test case then writing the code to make the test pass.

The three laws of TDD.

1. do not write any code unless it is to make a failing test pass

2. only write sufficient code that is to make a test case pass

3. only write sufficient unit test that is to fail

In python one can test code using one of two modules:

* doctest

* unittest
