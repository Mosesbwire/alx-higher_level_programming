## INHERITANCE

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows new classes to be based on existing classes, inheriting their attributes and methods.

Inheritance works by defining a new class that inherits the properties of an existing class, known as the superclass or parent class.

The new class, known as the subclass or child class, can then add its own attributes and methods, or override those of the parent class.

Inheritance allows us to reuse existing code and avoid duplicating code across multiple classes.

It also allows us to create a hierarchy of classes with increasing levels of specialization, making our code more organized and easier to maintain.
